  <h2>To Prospective Students Wishing to Study Abroad</h2>
  <div class="inner">
    <p>Thank you very much for your interest in my research and laboratory. Our laboratory welcomes students specializing in cultural anthropology, particularly those who wish to conduct research based on fieldwork and participant observation. Please note that we cannot provide supervision for studies that rely primarily on quantitative surveys, statistical analysis, or questionnaire-based research.</p>

    <h3>1. Language Proficiency</h3>
    <p>At present, classes, presentations, discussions, and research supervision in this laboratory are conducted primarily in Japanese. While research papers written in English are acceptable, we strongly recommend learning Japanese to ensure a more meaningful study abroad experience. Applicants to our laboratory as research students are required to demonstrate a certain level of proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking Japanese at the time of application.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Research students aiming to pursue a Master’s degree: Equivalent to JLPT N1</li>
      <li>Exchange students or research students not seeking admission to the Master’s program: Equivalent to JLPT N2, or TOEFL iBT 70, or IELTS 6.5</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. MEXT Scholarship through Embassy Recommendation</h3>
    <p>In the case of a MEXT scholarship through embassy recommendation, please contact the AAO (see “Procedures and Communication 2.(2)”) after receiving notification of passing the first screening. Please note that we do not respond to individual emails.</p>

    <h3>3. Master’s Program</h3>
    <p>Those wishing to enter our laboratory as Master’s students must pass the entrance examination of the Graduate School of Human and Environmental Studies (either the Cultural Anthropology Course or the Gender Studies Course).</p>

    <h3>4. Research Students</h3>
    <h4>(1) Selection of Research Students Aiming for a Master’s Degree</h4>
    <p>We accept up to one research student per year through the following selection process. Research students may begin their enrollment either in April or October.</p>
    <p><strong>For April Enrollment:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>By July of the previous year: Submit required documents through the university academic affairs office</li>
      <li>August: Submission of an assignment report (issued if document screening is passed)</li>
      <li>October: Interview at Kyoto University or online (in English or Japanese)</li>
      <li>November: Submission of official application documents to the university</li>
      <li>January: Issuance of a Certificate of Admission as a Research Student</li>
      <li>April: Enrollment as a Research Student</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>(2) Assignment Report</h4>
    <p>After confirming the submitted documents, an assignment report related to cultural anthropology will be given via email. The report must be written in Japanese or English and submitted by the deadline in August. Based on the application documents and the report, we will evaluate the relevance to our laboratory’s research themes, clarity and feasibility of the research plan, and the applicant’s knowledge and ability in cultural anthropology to determine admission.</p>

    <h4>(3) Interview</h4>
    <p>Applicants who pass the document screening will be interviewed online in October.</p>

    <h4>(4) After Admission as a Research Student</h4>
    <p>Research students are expected to participate in weekly seminars and write a bulletin paper, which will serve as the basis for deciding whether to approve their application for the Master’s entrance examination. Please note that admission to the Master’s program in our laboratory is not guaranteed.</p>
